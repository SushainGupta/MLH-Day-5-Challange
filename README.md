<h3>Guessing game is a game where you need to guess the number as per the required instances.</h3>
<p>
  To get this game running, I used random module to genrate a random integer from a specific range of numbers.
  The rest of the code is basic python with a function "get_integer" defined, if-else and while loops.
  Its super easy to code this down and have fun playing around.
  I hope this helps you!
